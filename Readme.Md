# Pngify.Me
The goal of this to build a functional software for any pngtuber, 
meaning a vtuber who just has a png/gif as their avatar.

Feel free to suggest features and submit code yourself

## Todo
- [ ] visualize location/preview location live in various layers
- [ ] web view -> just display current image on web, need ws connection of some sort probably
- [ ] layers
	- [ ] cpu/gpu temp layer (might need admin access for this though... https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor) 
- [ ] multi twitch account 
- [x] crash splash screen?
	- [x] link to discord or steam discussions
	- [x] fatal errors show message that needs to be acknowledged
- [ ] Common trigger setup -> here the same code is copied multiple times for now

## Roadmap (future stuff)
- [ ] collab feature like VTS has, invite your friends and see their PNG too
- [ ] virtual webcam integration
	- [ ] https://github.com/tedd/Tedd.VirtualNetworkCam
	- [ ] https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/437617/DirectShow-Virtual-Video-Capture-Source-Filter-in
- [ ] controller tracking

## Support
The goal is to have this be usuable for free, downloadable from git, itch.io and steam.
Also it should integrate a ton of features whilst remaining lightweight.
